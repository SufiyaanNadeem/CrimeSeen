This Online Map Interface helps newcomers navigate unfamiliar neighbourhoods with safety. The Google Maps API has been used to create popups for local police stations and neighborhoods for which data has been collected from <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/toronto/features/crimemap/#">CBC</a>. Simply click on a marker and look at specific crime statistics from that community.
